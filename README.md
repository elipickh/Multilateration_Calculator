# Multilateration_Calculator
R code to calculate the approx location of an emitter given known locations of receivers and signal detection times

This is an R rewrite of Paul Hayes' [adaption](https://github.com/paulhayes/MultilaterationExample) in Python of Andr√© Andersen's multilateration [method](http://blog.andersen.im/2012/07/signal-emitter-positioning-using-multilateration).
